## DESCRIPTION
The goal of this mod is to make combat more immersive by simulating the quality of the attacker's attack. It is not easy to get a good hit against someone you have low chance to hit. So the quality of your hits are now affected by your chance to hit, showing that you some times manage a glancing hit, sometimes an almost perfect hit, sometimes a fumbled hit and sometimes a perfect hit.

## FEATURES
- All hits have a chance to do reduced damage based on the chance to hit. The distribution follows a bell curve.
- The parameters of the mod and the distribution can be adjusted using provided Mod Settings.
- The mod adds immersive entries to the Combat Log describing the quality of the hit and the damage reduction.

## COMPATIBILITY
- Compatible with everything.
- Can be added to and removed from save files without any problem.
